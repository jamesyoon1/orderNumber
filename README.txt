Order Number Announcement System (4/14/2022)

To run this file, open index.html on Google Chrome browser. 

Preferably the browser does have an internet connection. Without Internet connection, Chrome uses different text to speech program.
A workaround will be made very soon. 

This program displays and announces order numbers that are ready for pickup. 
Employees can enter a number (3 digits only) and press enter to display the order number

As configured, number is displayed along with a ding sound, number, and "Your food is ready" speech.
All of this can be changed as the owners liking. 


Mainly, colors can be changed to fit the restaurants' themes by changing by modifying CHANGECOLOR.css file. 
The CSS file is documented to show which line to modify to change what. 

For the logo to be displayed, find a transparent background png and name it "logo.png". Place this png file in the same folder as index.html. 

/logos folder holds test logos can be discarded.
